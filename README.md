## üî§ Install Fonts

My favorite font is **Zed Mono** and **BlexMono Nerd Font** ‚ö°Ô∏è (The ones that Zed Editor uses).

| [ZedMono Nerd Font](/fonts/ZedMonoNerdFont)                      | I have my own copy at `"/fonts/ZedMono Nerd Font"`. Downloaded from [cabrinha's fork](https://github.com/cabrinha/nerd-fonts/tree/zed-fonts/patched-fonts/ZedMono) of [ryanoasis/nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). You can also download from ryanoasis's repo. I only downloaded the "Extended" |
| [BlexMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)   | Official Nerd Font                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use `ZedMono NF Extended` in VSCode or Zed (This is the unique name in FontBook)
>
> If that doesn't work, use `Zed Mono Nerd Font`, but make sure that you only downloaded the Extended style.
>
> Use `ZedMono Nerd Font` and `Extended` for Terminal or iTerm.
